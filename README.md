# Cobalt

This is an operating system, implemented from the ground up, for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod. Its purpose is to provide more flexibility for various other projects of mine. While I'm sure that the same things can be accomplished with OpenOS, likely more easily, reimplementing the entire OS layer gave me an opportunity to understand all of its moving parts.

## Installation

You can install Cobalt from OpenOS with the provided script in `/extras`. On your OpenOS machine, retrieve this file by running:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perrymacmurray/cobalt/master/extras/openos-installer.lua`

Then, execute this file with your desired installation directory:

`openos-installer.lua /mnt/<drive>`
